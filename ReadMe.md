My Thougts on this project.

**************************************************************************************************************************************

When I first got this project I was thinking to myself how hard could this be. But I must say this was a complete learning curve for webpage layout and styling it. I went so deep into how powerful CSS is and learn alot more about html tags. This one small project has thought me so much and I would recommend anyone that is new to web development to try this project.

I will just let you know some of the resources i used for this project.

1. W3schools.(Personally I found it to be the best when it comes to html and CSS for beginners).

2. Freecodecamp.org. Excellent website.

3. Google.com/ It has become my new best friend.

Just a bit of advice. Just don't copy and paste snippets of codes into your project. Fool around with the codes, see what effects each snippets does especially when it comes to CSS. This project took me about three days to complete but I could've finished it in about a day if I had just copy and paste. But I fooled around with every bit of the code so I could understand exactly what each code was doing

Thats my two cents. Happy coding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
